Hey There

I am writing this read me to explain to any current user of this file to explain the impportance of this endeavor. As a broke, indebted 
asset-less millenial seeking a career change, I cannot underestimate the importance of this skill set. It could, and should, be the means 
to understanding purpose and direction in this otherwise depressing workforce that I find myself immersed in. Hopefully this is the first 
of many tell alls detailing my purpose seeking the change I need in coding.
